## 🔧 What has been built?
- Basic login and authorisation using Breeze
- A user dashboard with all rented movies
- The Openweathermap API for "The excuse corner" showing the weather
- A library containing all the movies avaliable on the website with filter options for titles and genres
- An admin dashboard for adding, updating and deleting movies

## 🤖 AI used
- Openweather API because it was the first time adding however I did get halfway on my own.
- Mundane tasks like creating the contents in a factory, seeders or forms used within the application after already building the models and migrations.
- Middleware for verifying the admin roles on users.
